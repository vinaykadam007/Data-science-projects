    "# Classification of Survived Passengers on Titanic Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'titanic-train.csv' contains data of passenger details aboard the titanic, and whether they survived or not. We have to make a model which will predict their survival. The features are as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Survived - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)  \n",
    "Pclass - Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)  \n",
    "Name - Name  \n",
    "Sex - Sex  \n",
    "Age - Age  \n",
    "SibSp - Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard  \n",
    "Parch - Number of Parents/Children Aboard  \n",
    "Ticket - Ticket Number  \n",
    "Fare - Passenger Fare (British pound)  \n",
    "Cabin - Cabin  \n",
    "Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Solve the following questions:\n",
    "1. Based on logical reasoning, decide which variables are absolutely not required or relevant to the model. List them down and drop those columns. \n",
    "2. Plot a bar chart of the survived column. \n",
    "3. Plot a bar chart of the number of females who survived and not, and similarly males who survived and not. \n",
    "4. **BONUS** Plot a stacked bar chart of survived or not based on PClass(i.e how many survived and not for 1st, 2nd and 3rd class). The graph can be made by referring to https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/bar_stacked.html\n",
    "5. Check if there are missing values in any columns. Remove such rows in the dataset.  \n",
    "6. Convert categorical values (if any) to numbers in the dataset.\n",
    "7. Plot a heatmap of the correlation between all columns. There are columns are inter-related. Which are those colums? Can you drop either one of the inter-related column before proceeding ahead?\n",
    "8. Now split your dataset into training & testing dataset with 80:20 ratio using train_test_split function. Use a random state which will give an approximately equal number of survived and non survived rows in the training test. Validate using a bar chart on the training dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree Modelling\n",
    "#### Use a decision tree classifier with a minimum depth of 6, to train your model. Obtain the confusion matrix for the predictions. Obtain the score of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perceptron Modelling\n",
    "#### Use a perceptron model with a max_iter value 400, to train your model. Obtain the confusion matrix for the predictions. Obtain the score of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Which of the two models fairs better? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### BONUS\n",
    "There is a relation between age and PClass. Can you fill in the missing values of age with this information instead of dropping the rows entirely?"
