    "# Exercise - Multivariate Regression with Red Wine Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains score of red wines (between 1-10) based on its composition. The dataset is at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality.\n",
    "We have to predict the score of wine based on its input. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The first step is analysis of the data. Plot & answer the following questions regarding the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine if there any values missing in any rows/columns. Filter out such rows. \n",
    "2. Find out the correlation of this dataset using pandas. Plot a heatmap of this matrix. Which features have a higher correlation with SCORE? Are there any features who have no correlation with score. Remove such columns.\n",
    "2. Plot different scatter plots of all feature variables with MEDV. Observe trends based on the plots. Are there any wines hving a score of 0, 1, 2, 9, 10? Plot a histogram of the same. (score vs number of wines having that score)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### With the analysis done above of the dataset, remove the columns which are not required. Perform Linear regression on this new filtered dataset. \n",
    "1. The training & test dataset should have data from all wine scores. Each score should have 80% training and 20% testing data.  Perform linear regression on the training dataset. Print the obtained co-efficients for every feature. Which features have more weightage? \n",
    "2. Plot a scatter of test prices vs obtained prices. Obtain the MSE, R^2 score of this model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### With the above dataset, perform linear regression with randomly selected training & testing datasets using train_test_split function. Perform the two steps listed above. Which model is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perform KFold Cross validation score on both the approaches. "
