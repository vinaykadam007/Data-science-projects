# Machine Learning Algorithms and Datasets Showcase

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms and Datasets Showcase! This GitHub project is your one-stop destination for exploring and experimenting with a diverse array of machine learning algorithms and datasets. From association learning to clustering, classification to regression, we've got it all covered. Here, you can discover the power of various machine learning techniques and their applications with real-world datasets.

## Key Features
### 1. Diverse Algorithms
#### Association Learning: Discover associations and patterns within datasets.
#### Clustering (K-means): Group data points into clusters for insights.
#### Classification: Employ Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Perceptron for classification tasks.
#### Regression: Utilize Linear, Polynomial, and Logistic Regression for predictive modeling.

### 2. Varied Datasets
Explore a rich collection of datasets, including but not limited to:
1. Iris Dataset
2. Titanic Dataset
3. McDonald's Data
4. Bag of Words
5. Diabetes Dataset
6. Winery Data
7. Automobile Data
And many more!

### 3. Code and Documentation
Each algorithm comes with well-documented code, making it easy for both beginners and experts to understand and implement. Dive into the codebase to learn, experiment, or adapt these algorithms for your own projects.
