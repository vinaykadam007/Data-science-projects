It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,\\n   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to\\n   any specified angle.\\no  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan\\n   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to\\n   region target mean, median, or modal value.\\no  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,\\n   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.\\no  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of\\n   region of an image.\\no  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot\\n   keyword values for a set of images.\\no  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,\\n   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower\\n   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

Then all the disciples\\nMat26:56 forsook him, and fled.\\n\\nIf the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not\\nbeen accessible then it probably would be a different\\nmatter.\", '\\n\\nActually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction\\nof the acceleration.

In this\\ncase, you can only put up with about 8 g\\'s even with a pressure suit.  \\n\\nThe record for acceleration, though, is measured along \"the direction\\nyou\\'re facing\" (for lack of a better term).

The problem is understanding the basic\\nchemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them\\nefficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from\\nplants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have\\nto orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use \\ntechnology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of \\nusing dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies\\nbring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in \\ndirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in \\nhydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is \\nstunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So \\nnow you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar\\ninteractions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's\\nwhat needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far.\\nWe also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.\\n\\n\\nFirst you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information\\nout there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.\\nThis could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then\\nwe can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.\\n\\n\\nUnless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,\\nI think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search \\nfirst.

King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\\n\\n * \"The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\\n *  treated as a matter of faith.\" -- Francis Hitching                     *\\n\\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\\n\\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\\n    not be your real intent.\\n\\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\\n\\n\\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\\n\\n * Neither I, nor Webster\\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\\n\\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings\\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\\n\\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\\ntitled \"`Giraffe\\' sticks scientific neck out too far\".  Excerpts include :\\n\\n  \"Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.\"  \"He goes after Darwin like Mark\\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.\"  \"He suggests\\n  a mystical `organizing principle\\' of life, using the similarity of organs\\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic].\"\\n\\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\\nagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn\\'t\\nsurprise me much.  It\\'s also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.\\nhe only posted a quote).\\n', '\\nProbably because it IS rape.\\n\\n\\nSo nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn\\'t give any\\ninsight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be\\ndependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.  And since\\nChristians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better\\nthan ours, I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary, or even\\nparticularly attractive.\\n\\n\\nWell, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the\\nvery least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there\\nwas a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural\\ndiety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against\\nit means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.\\n\\n\\nThis is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily\\ndocumented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and\\nthat is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or\\none\\'s ignorance.  Someone else will address this I\\'m sure, and refer you to\\nplenty of documentation...\\n\\n\\nHow is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to\\nmanipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the\\ncoming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is\\nautmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.\\n\\n\\nWell, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get\\ninto us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify\\nexactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge. \\nIf I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my\\nenkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will \"feel\"\\nright, and I will trust without knowing).

P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\\nnecessarily no new observation (we\\'ve already seen the dosh) to change\\nthose estimates.

See my post on the other branch of this\\n#thread.\\n\\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.

And I\\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\\'s\\ncertainly possible that I\\'ve misunderstood what you\\'re saying).  However,\\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don\\'t exist, or are unnecessary\\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\\na fallacy upon close examination.

Hades may be \\nlikened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)\\n\\n    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell\\nto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  \\n\\n    Why?  Because when seeing the word \"hell\" many readers impute to it the \\ntraditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never \\nremotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!\\n\\n    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of \\nthe dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \\n\"shadowy realm.\"  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to \\nthis hell.\\n\\n    The second \"hell\" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in \\nscripture, 2 Pet.2:4; \"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \\nthem down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be \\nreserved unto judgment...\"\\n\\n    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; \\nRev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels \\n(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to \\nTartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the \\nmutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).\\n\\n    Tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or\\ndemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe \\nthe place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible \\nis there any mention of men being put into this particular \"hell\".\\n\\n    The the third word that is translated as \"hell\" in the Bible is Gehenna. It\\ncomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning \"valley of Hinniom.\"  Hinnom is a \\ndeep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.\\n\\n    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including \\ninfant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made \\ntheir children \"pass through the fire\" to the god Molech.  The rites were \\nspecifically celebrated in Tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief \\ngroves in the valley).\\n\\n    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He \\ndefiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later \\nthe valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for \\nsewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were \\nalso burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding \\nby a constant supply of garbage and refuse.\\n\\n    Aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchased with the money Judas received for\\nthe betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.\\n\\n    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  \\n\\n    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working \\nreligious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the \\nre-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.\\nTheir fate is revealed by the apostle John: \"And the beast was taken, and with \\nhim the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire \\nburning with brimstone.\"\\n    \\n    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this \"hell\") be?\\n\\n    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: \"For \\nTophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is \\nprepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, \\nthe breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" (Isa.30:33).\\n\\n    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled \\nfiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).\\n\\n    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible \\nsay that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of \\nfire?\\n\\n    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be \\nthrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will \\nbecome of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? \\n \\n    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna \\nfire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This \\npunishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the \\n\"second death\" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a \\nfurther resurrection.\\n\\n    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.\\n                           \\n    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. \"For, behold, the day \\ncometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do \\nwickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...\"\\n(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be \"ashes under the \\nsoles of your feet...\"(Mal.4:3).\\n\\n    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living \\ntorture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or \\nvalley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, \\nbut ashes!\\n \\n    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means \\ncomplete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The \\nBible says, in Romans 6:23, \"The wages of sin is death\", not eternal life in \\ntorture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of \\nlife.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\n   for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\\'m not sure about Premiere).\\n\\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\\nmake a real difference.\\n\\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\\n\\n-Peter Lee\\n\\n ', \"\\n\\n \\nCertainly. Reference follows. \\n\\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\\n\\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\\n\\n\\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\\nhave the monitor data.\\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\\nwhite) until it is displayable.\\n\\n\\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\\n\\n--\\nChris Lilley\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \\nManchester, UK.

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\", \"\\n\\n\\nYou can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with\\nthe differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network.\\nIgnore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time\\nof arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged, one can often\\nget positions down to ~arc minutes.\\n\\nBTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the\\nfairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1\\nms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a\\ndistance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing\\nand t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the\\norder of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce this\\nnumber considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the\\nwrong direction.\", \"Well, I seem to have struck an  interesting discussion off.

Now the charge of\\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \\ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \\nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case.\\n\\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation\\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \\nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \\nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \\nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \\nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\\n\\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \\noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\\nMuslims, and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe\\nthat one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\\nEvery verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\\nimpinge on the situation.\\n\\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an.\\nThe Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\\nthe\\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \\nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \\nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \\nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\\n\\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \\nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\\nthe Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\\nthe Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an....\".\\n\\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic\\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \\nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \\npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\\'ve listed a few major \\ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\\nheadings.\\n\\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\\n- Logic (mantiq)\\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\\nReasoning)\\n\\nThe study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\\n- discussion of tacit meanings\\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\\n\\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\\n- principles of exemption\\n- principles of precaution\\n- principles of option\\n- principles of mastery\\n\\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \\n\\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \\nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\\nof God!

If they do that, fear for\\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\\n\\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \\ndelineated in the Qur\\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\\nare praised in both the Qur\\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \\nare cautioned.\\n\\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\\napostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least\\nbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a\\nheretic\\nbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of\\ncreating a straw man and then beating him.\\n\\n\\nI agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.\\nUnfortunately,\\nI do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated\\ngroup\\nis out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like\\nsoc.religion.islam.

It\\'s from\\n\\n  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG\\')  where G\\' is the complement of G\\n\\nand by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG\\') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).\\n\\nIn a sense, HG is necessarily more \"complicated\" than H for any H and G,\\nso I may be splitting hairs, but what I\\'m trying to say is that irrespective\\nof subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)\\nholds, with equality if and only if P(HG\\') = 0.\\n\\n\\nWell, \"P(x | A) = P(x | B)\" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is\\noperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not\\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\\n\\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\\n\\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\\n\\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\\n\\nSo A and B are \"equally consistent with the data\" in that observing x\\ndoesn\\'t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\\n\\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don\\'t know\\nthe actual values, and it\\'s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\\nthrow out any such HG.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or\\nnot a `divine component\\' actually underlies the prevalence of religion\\nin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious\\nimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word\\'.\\n\\nNow it seems to me, as I\\'ve said, that the observed variance in religious\\nbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather\\n*less* well if one proposes a `divine component\\' in addition, since I would\\nexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual\\nexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn\\'t\\neven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,\\nG is `divine component\\', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily\\nacknowledge that this is a subjective impression.\\n\\n\\nNot that I\\'m a statistician as such either, but:\\n\\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\\nthe (read `my\\') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\\nmeasurable ways.\\n\\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \\nwhich I loosely termed \"appearances of god/s\", have some nonzero\\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\\n\\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\\nexpends on making \"appearances of god/s\" possible must come from somewhere\\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\\n\\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn\\'t* an\\n\"appearance of god/s\" must have a slightly higher probability under\\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\\n\\nSorry if that\\'s still a bit jargonesque, but it\\'s rather difficult to\\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\\narea under them is always unity.\\n\\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is \"the\\ncoin is fair\", and that B is \"the coin is unfair (two-headed)\". (I\\'ve\\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\\n\\nThen\\n\\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\\n\\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\\n\\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\\ndon\\'t actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\\nof heads.\\n\\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\\nmodified according to\\n\\n                            P(H | A)\\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nand\\n\\n                            P(H | B)\\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nNow we don\\'t know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\\n\\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\\n\\n                 n\\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\\n\\nand\\n                    n\\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\\n\\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\\n\\nThe loose analogy is between \"unfair coin\" and atheism, and between \"fair\\ncoin\" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\\nwould falsify \"unfair coin\", is analogous to an \"appearance of god/s\",\\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\\nis the same.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call \"the G in the HG\",\\nin terms of our Ockham\\'s Razor discussion, and I\\'d bin it on those grounds.\\n\\n\\nThe hypotheses don\\'t have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model\\',\\nthe theism isn\\'t falsifiable.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to. We don\\'t need, in the above analogy, to know *any*\\nprior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the\\nfair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding\\nmultiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.\\nYou don\\'t need to know the initial values of the running estimates\\neither. It\\'s clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)\\napproaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.\\n\\nAll you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for\\nobserved x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain\\nevents rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible\\nunder Ha, and all else is equal.\\n\\n\\nAny observations you like; it really doesn\\'t matter, nor affect the\\nreasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which\\nwould count as \"appearances of god/s\". Examples of this might be\\na demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of\\nrevelation.\\n\\n\\n\\nOK, we\\'ll downgrade \"*does* interact\" to \"*may* interact\", which would\\nactually be better since \"does interact\" implies a falsifiability which\\nwe both agree is misplaced.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll explain, but bear in mind that this isn\\'t central; all I require of\\na theism is that it *not* make the prediction \"Appearances of god/s will\\nnever happen\", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum\\nmechanics doesn\\'t make this prediction either, the difference is that\\nQM and atheism do not form a partition.)\\n\\nPredictions include such statements as \"Prayer is efficacious\" (implying\\n\"If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious\"), or \"Prayer\\nis *not* efficacious\", or \"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not\\npass, till all these things be fulfilled.\" I don\\'t think we have any problems\\nof misunderstanding here.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s fine; I don\\'t claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite\\nnumber of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and\\nthat as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think you are; an \"appearance of god/s\" is sufficient to falsify\\natheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.\\n\\n\\nNo: by way of a counterexample, let X = \"the coin is fair\", or more\\naccurately (so that not(X) makes sense) \"the two sides of the coin are\\ndifferent\". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of\\nheads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite\\nnumber of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable,\\nand is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOops. Sorry.

In the past it seems to me there were always two \\ncoexisting methods of social control.\\n\\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \\nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \\nof punishments.\\n\\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \\nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \\nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \\nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \\nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \\nsocial censure.\\n\\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as \"guilt\" and \\n\"morality\".  I\\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\\'t for \\nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \\nabsolutely impossible.\\n\\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \\nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\\'t \\nillegal, then don\\'t pick on me).

While we \\nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \\nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \\ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \\ncontinued destabilization of society.  \\n\\nI got no quick fix.

Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky.

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\nit *must* be so-and-so.', '\\n\\n\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I mind?

After hearing your\\nseemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim\\nregarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statement\\nregarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such response\\nregarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams.

I believe you mistakenly assume\\nthat defense of Koresh\\' right to his own personal beliefs and his\\nright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh\\'\\ntheology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-\\nDavidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect\\nof the tragic events of the past few days.\\n\\nNor do I think Koresh\\' sex life should be of any interest to the\\nfederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting\\ninfants so it must be true even though such allegations do not\\nfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are\\nstate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the\\nlocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge having\\never been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent\\nas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least\\nthat\\'s how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-\\ngandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a\\nlustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might\\nbring upon him.  \\n\\nBut evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the\\nbuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined\\nby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse\\nand none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with\\nDavidians several times before the conflagration, reported that\\nthe children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.\\n\\nUltimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh\\nis quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a\\nmost wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.\\nSo I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One\\nwho has all knowledge.

It is built on two \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \\n          space and time: \\n          \\n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \\n          \\n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \\n          \\n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \\n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \\n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \\n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \\n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \\n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \\n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \\n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \\n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \\n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \\n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \\n          ready for those also. \\n          \\n               As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE \\n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \\n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \\n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \\n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \\n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \\n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \\n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \\n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \\n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \\n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \\n          used to maintain them. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \\n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \\n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \\n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \\n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \\n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \\n          formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \\n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \\n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \\n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \\n          SINGLE stars. \\n          \\n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \\n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \\n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \\n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \\n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \\n          \\n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \\n          observations that contradict their theories would find \\n          Larson\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \\n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \\n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \\n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \\n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \\n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \\n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \\n          coincidence).  Larson\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \\n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \\n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic \\n          sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \\n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \\n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \\n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \\n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \\n          at random. \\n          \\n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \\n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \\n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \\n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \\n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \\n          \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann, \\n          says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \\n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \\n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson\\'s book contains \\n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \\n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \\n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n   [re: voyages of discovery...]\\n   Could you give examples of privately funded ones?\\n\\nIf you believe 1492 (the film), Columbus had substantial private\\nfunds.

The \"large\"\\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\\nthe energy they have absorbed.\\n\\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\\nby any conceivable observation.\\n\\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\\n\"average\" temperature.\\n\\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\\n\\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\\ntake the fourth root.

Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft\\n\\tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,\\n\\tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed\\n\\tgovernment officials.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by\\n\\tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had\\n\\tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill\\n\\tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he\\n\\thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written \"by\\n\\tthe commandment of God,\" claims that the ancient Hebrews\\n\\tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors\\n\\tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who\\n\\thave been baptized in the \"true church\" will be reunited\\n\\tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can\\n\\tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the\\n\\thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been\\n\\tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and\\n\\tas heretics by religious fundamentalists.\\n\\t\\n\\tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was\\n\\tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because\\n\\tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from\\n\\tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,\\n\\twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham\\n\\tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over\\n\\tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further\\n\\twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. \\n\\tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of\\n\\tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice\\n\\tin nineteenth-century America.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhile other religions go back many centuries --\\n\\tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,\\n\\t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are\\n\\tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon\\n\\troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this\\n\\thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny\\n\\tis dangerous to the faith.\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles\\n\\tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong\\n\\tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical\\n\\texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion\\n\\tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a\\n\\tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the\\n\\thistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz\\n\\t\\n\\nThe article itself is super.', '\\nI realy like this idea, it would be wonderfull to see such a \\nbig bright satelite on the night sky.

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \\n    for the planet Venus. \\n\\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \\n\\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\'\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\n\\n        The Soviet probes\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\\n    VENERAs\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \\n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \\n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\n\\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \\n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\' \\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\n\\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \\n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \\n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \\n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \\n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\n    across, due to Venus\\' very dense atmosphere.\\n\\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\' \\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \\n\\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \\n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \\n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\n\\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \\n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\'s\\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\n\\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \\n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \\n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \\n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\\n\\n        Venus by Balloon\\n\\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\'s mantle of \\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \\n    the French space agency Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\n\\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \\n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \\n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \\n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\n\\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \\n\\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \\n\\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\n    encounter.\\n\\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\\n    Japan\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\n    comet, while Japan\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \\n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \\n\\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \\n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \\n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\\n\\n        The Soviets\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \\n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \\n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \\n    location of the comet\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\\n\\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\\n    successfully arrived. \\n\\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\n    permeated the planet\\'s atmosphere. \\n\\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \\n    had thought the planet\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\n\\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\n    journey.  The layer\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\n\\n        Early in the first balloon\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \\n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\n    miles) above the surface. \\n\\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \\n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\'s \\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\n\\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \\n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\\n    returned during the lander\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \\n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\n\\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\'s results\\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \\n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \\n    over the last seven years.\\n\\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\n\\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \\n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\n    miles) towards the surface.\\n\\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \\n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \\n    through the balloon\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\'s nephelometer \\n    failed to function.\\n\\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\\n    Terra\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\'s resting place was smoother\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \\n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\\n\\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\n    hours.\\n\\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \\n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\n\\n        Future Plans Diverted\\n\\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\\n    the early 1990s.\\n\\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \\n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\'s \\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\n    the VEGA balloons\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \\n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\\n\\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \\n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \\n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \\n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \\n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\n    Mars\\' largest moon, Phobos. \\n\\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\n\\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\n    landing in March of 1989. \\n\\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\n\\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\n\\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\n    make money.  \\n\\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \\n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \\n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\\n\\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \\n\\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\\n\\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \\n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \\n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \\n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \\n    probe\\'s primary target\\'s major moons in 1610.\\n\\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\'s first planetary\\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\\n    planet\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\n\\n        On the Drawing Boards\\n\\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \\n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \\n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\\n\\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \\n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\\n    to study Venus\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\n\\n        Humans on Venus      \\n\\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\\n    Earth\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\n    to speed up the planet\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\\n    if not millennia.\\n\\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\\n\\n        Bibliography -\\n\\n         Barsukov, V.

That\\nis what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or\\nbelief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)\\njustification.\\n\\nFor example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't know\\nwhy they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.\\n\\nDogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based\\non new information, or increased mental faculty.\\n\\nFaith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion\\nare responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that\\nfaith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that\\nmakes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather\\nthan a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,\\nbecause there is no faith nor dogma.\\n\\nHave you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher\\nis not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.\\n\\nA Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is\\na special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,\\nto conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence\\nof That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma\\ncomes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example\\nof faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.\\nSure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the\\nneeds of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,\\nand that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the\\ninterpretations are flawed.\\n\\nScience, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a\\nBUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.\\nA scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to\\nsuit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,\\n*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs\\nare deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving\\nthe beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect\\nthe best information currently available.  That's the only rational\\nthing to do.  That's good philosophy.\\n\\nCan you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,\\nand new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many\\nscientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding\\nof everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion\\nviews its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of\\nthose beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which\\nconflicts with them.\\n\\nIt's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require\\na good rational justification of the killing.

Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.

On what\\nra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call \"orthodox?\"\\n\\n     \"Orthodox\" is a compound word. It comes from \\'orthos\\' (straight, true, \\n     right) and from \\'doxa\\' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to \\n     refer to \\'right teaching.\\' Right teaching is derived from letting God \\n     speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths \\n     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.\\n\\nra> Who is that \"holds that\" Luke meant what you said he meant?\\n\\n     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are\\n     pertinent.\\n\\n     Luke 23:43 records Christ\\'s promise to the repentant thief who hung on\\n     an adjacent cross: \"Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in\\n     paradise.\" But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead\\n     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until\\n     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The\\n     answer lies in the location of \"paradise\" when Jesus died.\\n\\n     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.\\n\\n     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and \\n     Lazarus as \"Abraham\\'s Bosom,\" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was\\n     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus\\n     \"Abraham\\'s Bosom\" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed\\n     waited till the day of Christ\\'s Resurrection.\\n\\n     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of \\n     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith\\n     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven\\n     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or\\n     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with\\n     the Father.\\n\\n     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the\\n     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But\\n     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene\\n     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then\\n     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise\\n     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in\\n     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: \"Ascending on high, He led captivity\\n     captive; He gave gifts unto men.\" Verse 9 continues: \"But what does `He\\n     ascended\\' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the\\n     earth?\" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: \"He who descended is the same\\n     as He who ascended above all the heavens.\" Presumably He led the whole\\n     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of\\n     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.\\n\\nra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is\\nra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to\\nra> \"look at the Bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who\\nra> see Biblical things differently from you?\\n\\n     I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my \\'personal \\n     interpretation\\' is questioned, I usually give a reason.\\n\\n     As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where\\n     there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. \\n\\n     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one \\n     views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff \\n     that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can \\n     have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put \\n     forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to \\n     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views\\n     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.\\n\\nra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really\\nra> understands it?\\n\\n     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is \\n     wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.

To accomplish\\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\\ncongressperson's staff review a bill.\\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\\nwritten.

For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). \\n\\nDear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993\\n\\nNumber 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you \\nwill receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured\\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\\ninto the discourse.\\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \\nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,\\nyou will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning\\nour common interest and job.\\n\\nAt the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in\\nevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various\\npossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and \\nphilosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,\\nand on the way to become significant.

As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number.

There\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\\nwhich solves yesterday\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \\nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \\nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \\n\\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.', 'Hello Ceci:\\n\\n     My name is Tony and I have a few comments on your \"rosicrucian\"\\nadventure.

At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\\n\\n     I\\'d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\\n\\n     Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they\\ndescend (at least in part) from what was the \"Gold-und-Rosenkreuz\" (Golden\\nand Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two \"Golden and Rosy\\nCross\", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with\\nMasonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).\\n\\n     \"You\\'ll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you\\'d probably have had a\\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \\n\\n     Again, instead of R:s, it should be \"Lectorium Rosicrucianum\" :-). It\\nis curious to know that 3 other RC \\'orders\\' (in the USA) claim to be *non-\\nsectarian*.\\n\\n     The Cathars were a \\'heretic\\' christian sect that directly challenged\\nthe \\'authority\\' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the\\n12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the\\ncrusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the\\nworldly ways of its clerics.

McConkie then stated what Mormons\\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\\n\\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\\n\\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\\nexamining McConkie\\'s attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\\n\\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\\n\\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title \\'Elohim\\'...\" (Articles of Faith,\\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\\n\\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\\n\\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\\n\\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\\n\\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\\nMcConkie\\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\\n\\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\\n  Messianic prophecy?\\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\\n  David\\'s son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\\n  unto David\\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \\'_The\\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\\n  sit on my right hand forever.\\' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\\n\\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\\n\\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\\nwhich reads:\\n\\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\\nthe Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\\n  Lord\\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\\n  Messiah, p. 532)\\n\\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\\'s \"arrest and\\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\\n\\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\\n\\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\\n\\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\\nwill be considered in this examination.\\n\\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\\n\\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas\\' role in\\nChrist\\'s death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\\n\\n        Another example involves McConkie\\'s following remark about Ps.\\n        110:4.\\n\\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\\n  p. 450)\\n\\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\\n\\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\\n     (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\\nhim [Christ]...\"\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\\nverses.\\n\\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\\nthese Scriptures:\\n\\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\\n\\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\\n\\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\\nthe Messiah.\\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\\n\\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\\n\\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\\n\\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\\'s prophecy. \"The\\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\\n\\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\\n\\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\\n\\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\\n\\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\\n\\n        Now, what about Mormonism\\'s claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\\nScriptures prove this fact:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\\n\\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\\n  son...

(Joel 2:32)\\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\\n\\n  \"Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\\n  22:12)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\\n  \"...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

(Heb. 10:15-17)\\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" and \"said\" added)\\n  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a\\n  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...\\n  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\\n  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people....

See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)\\n\\n        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that\\n\"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.\\n\\n  \"And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,\\n  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\\n  Moses, Moses.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\\n\\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah\\'s\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\\n5:27)\\n\\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\\nBible reveals that \"Elohim\\'s\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\\n\\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...\\'Elohim,\\' is the literal Parent\\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\\n\\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\\nman\\'s spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\\ntruth about who created man.\\n\\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\\n  him_.

If they are\\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit...

(Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\\n\\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\\n\\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\\n\\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\\n\\n        Regarding the Mormon \\'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\\n\\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\\n\\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\\n\\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\\n\\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\\n  developed....\\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\\n  Father, and to him only....\\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\\n\\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\\n\\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\\n\\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\\n\\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\\n\\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\\n\\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\\n\\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\\n\\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\\n\\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\\n\\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\\nidolatry.\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\\n\\n  \"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\\n\\n  \"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\\n  (Josh. 23:7)\\n\\n  \"...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\\n\\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\\n\\n  \"And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\\n\\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\\n\\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\\n  24:15-16)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\\nand all therein.\\n\\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\\n\\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim\\'s\" covenant\\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim\\'s\" of\\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\\n\\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\\n\\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\\nworld to redeem mankind.\\n\\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\\n\"Jehovah.\"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\\'s statement that the Mormons\\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\\n\\n        In answer to Jesus\\' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\\n\\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\\n\\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\\n1)\\n\\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\\n\\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\\n\\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\\n\\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\\n\\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life.

What\\'s\\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\\nenough by those who don\\'t believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\\n\\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\\n\\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\\n\\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \\ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\\n\\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\\nevangelist\\'s point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul\\'s mention (at least; this\\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\\n\\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\\'S notion,\\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\\' command\\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\\n\\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\\n[ I don\\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\\n\\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John\\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\\ndoes NOT say \\'hate your enemy\\' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I\\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the\\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\\nChristians.\\n\\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\\' final journey to\\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn\\'t prevented Christians from MAKING\\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\\neven (contrary to Jesus\\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don\\'t\\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\\n\"equivalent\" of John\\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\\n\\n\\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\\n\\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\\n\\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\\n\\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\\'\\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\\nour understanding the point of Jesus\\' use of the Torah in the (all quite\\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\\n\\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\\n\\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \\ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\\n\\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \\ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \\npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew\\'s\\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\\'t,\\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\\nof the synoptic tradition?\\n\\nI\\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\\'t* enter into \\nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\\nwe are faced with as Christians.

Such PRINCIPLES OF \\n          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern \"science\" and help to \\n          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox \\n          modern theories. \\n          \\n               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a \\n          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-\\n          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT \\n          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated \\n          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. \\n          \\n               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, \\n          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by \\n          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, \\n          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they \\n          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy \\n          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by \\n          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced \\n          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and \\n          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and \\n          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are \\n          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly \\n          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. \\n          \\n               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, \\n          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for \\n          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly \\n          tapping into energy circulating through the earth\\'s magnetic \\n          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to \\n          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in \\n          \"Science & Mechanics\" magazine, Spring 1980, (\"Amazing \\n          Magnet-Powered Motor\", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, \\n          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, \\n          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such \\n          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible \\n          heatpump in one\\'s home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.

They typically have a \\'SPARK GAP\\' in the circuit \\n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \\n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \\n          \\'inductance\\' and \\'capacitance\\' of the Device combine to \\n          \\'RESONATE\\' at the same frequency as \\'EARTH RESONANCE\\' in \\n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \\n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \\'NEUTRAL CENTER\\' \\n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \\n          Tesla Coil, slipping a \\'TOROID CHOKE COIL\\' around the \\n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [\"Earth Energy: \\n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\", by John Bigelow, 1976, \\n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \\n          \\n               During the 1930\\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named \\n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \\n          \\'IMPLOSION TURBINE\\' (German name, \\'ZOKWENDLE\\'), after \\n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \\n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \\n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book \"A \\n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\", by Dan A. Davidson, \\n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \\n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \\n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \\n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \\n          which then converts the pump\\'s motor into an ELECTRIC \\n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \\n          of the earth\\'s rotation, via the \\'Coriolis effect\\', LIKE A \\n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \\n          \\n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \\'McClintock \\n          Air Motor\\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \\n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \\n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \\n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \\n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \\n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \\n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \\n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \\n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \\n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \\n          \\n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \\n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \\n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \\n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \\n          common household smoke detector. \\n          \\n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \\n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \\n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \\n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \\n          reactor which he calls \\'Migma\\', which uses NON-radioactive \\n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \\n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \\n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \\n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \\n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \\n          \"Tokamaks\" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \\n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \\n          for every watt put in.  [\"New Times\" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \\n          pages 32-40.] \\n          \\n               And then there are the \\'cold fusion\\' experiments that \\n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \\n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \\n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \\n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \\n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \\n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \\n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \\n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \\n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \\n          \\n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called \"laws\" \\n          of thermodynamics are NOT so \"absolute\".  For example, the \\n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \\'Reciprocal System\\', (which he describes in detail \\n          in several books such as \"Nothing But Motion\" (1979) and \"The \\n          Universe of Motion\" (1984)), in which the physical universe \\n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \\n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \\n          between them, with-OUT the \"heat death\" predicted by \\n          thermodynamic \"laws\".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \\n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \\n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \\n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \\n          seemingly converting \"low-quality energy\" into \"high-quality \\n          energy\". \\n          \\n               Also, certain religious organizations such as \\'Sant Mat\\' \\n          and \\'Eckankar\\' teach their Members that the physical universe \\n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \\n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \\n          channels, as described in books like \"The Path of the \\n          Masters\", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and \"Eckankar: The Key \\n          to Secret Worlds\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \\n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \\n          called the \\'Astral Plane\\'.  Long-time Members of these groups \\n          have learned to \\'Soul Travel\\' into these higher worlds and \\n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \\n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \\n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \\n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \\n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \\n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \\n          those described in the book \"Psychic Discoveries Behind the \\n          Iron Curtain\". \\n          \\n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors \\n          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop \\n          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional \\n          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their \\n          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If \\n          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of \\n          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and \\n          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and \\n          pollution and its harmful effects (including the \\'GREENHOUSE \\n          EFFECT\\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil \\n          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue \\n          to increase. \\n          \\n               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development \\n          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize \\n          private production (until the producers can make it on their \\n          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of \\n          Free Energy Hardware. \\n          \\n               The long-range effects of such government intervention \\n          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy \\n          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining \\n          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, \\n          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to \\n          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \\n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \\n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \\n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \\n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\\'s, \\n          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that \\n          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, \\n          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be \\n          able to realize the \"opportunity costs\" of paying electric \\n          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would \\n          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to \\n          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government \\n          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be \\n          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE \\n          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. \\n          \\n               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of \\n          business, but society as a whole, and the earth\\'s environment \\n          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People, \\n          that government should serve, rather than the big \\n          corporation$ and bank$. \\n          \\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (patents, articles, books). \\n\\n          \\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \\n', ' \\n(Deletion)\\n \\nIt has.

During the pull-out to\\nparabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I\\nhad to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically\\nuseless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in\\nthe back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just\\nthis purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.\\n(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous\\npeople who don\\'t get sick on the thing.)\\n\\nI didn\\'t think of it as a \"constant sensation of falling\" so\\nmuch as like swimming in air.

Saying someone\\n#is a theist holds much more information. Further, the correlation between\\n#theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism\\n#because of the special features of theistic belief.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.

It takes just a nifty improvement in the\\n#theology.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n#>\\n#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\n#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\n#>to the case you are trying to make?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people\\n#causing the correlation.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \\nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\\n\\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\\n\\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\\n\\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\\n\\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC', \"Given that what i described for the HST  seemed to be the SMT,   and given\\nthe mass amrgins on the discovery mission  is tight enough that  spacewalking\\nhas to be carefully constrained.....

I, myself, think the F-86 is\\na beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn't even think of flying\\nit in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles\\non how they perform.\\n\\n\\nNot to this degree.\\n\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n\\nYour wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has\\nthe advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle\\nisn't reusable, it's salvagable).\\n\\n\\nThe flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X\\nshows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.\\n\\n\\nThe final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight\\nenvelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available\\nthrust and still land safely.\\n\\n\\nEverything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same\\nthing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.\\n\\n\\nYou don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You\\nwouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for\\nharmful side effects would you?\\n\\n\\nYou are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it\\nwill still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do\\nneed to do to build SSTO.\\n\\n\\nAgain, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout\\nthe flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't.\\n\\n\\nNot true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will\\ncarry passengers.\\n\\n\\nI would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original\\nschedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.\\n\\n\\nYour ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being\\nunreliable and hugely expensive.

(Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism\\ncounts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  \\n\\nTo what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your\\nbeliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \\n\\n\\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \\nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \\n\\n\\nTo what extent do you feel you \"understand\" the universe through your beliefs?\\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \\nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \\nan explanatory method?  \\n\\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would\\nconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the \\nplausibility of God\\'s existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs\\n-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for\\nsome time?  \\n\\nAre you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you\\nthink science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science\\nwas the new \"secular religion,\" and that \"scientists are, in a very real sense,\\nthe new priesthood.\"  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-\\nreligious base, or even a religious element?)  \\n\\n---------------\\n\\nThis survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but\\nalso to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose\\nideas and histories could be very useful to me.

Lucifer\\'s aspirations (\"I\\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\\n\\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\\nwe made that choice individually.

I can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\\'s\\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\nI\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\\n\\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\\'s worst when the NPC Z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\\n\\nI\\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test\\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;\\nthis version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX\\n5.1.\\n\\nOpen questions:\\n    (1) Why does this happen?\\n        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?\\n        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines\\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\\n            could be corrected for?\\n        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their\\n            interpolators?\\n        --  Something else?\\n    (2) What to do about it?\\n        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\\n            in Z-buffered HLHSR?\\n        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching\\n            artifacts?\\n        --  Am I just out of luck?\\n\\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!\\n', \"Come on, this is sci.space.

For every twenty or so\\nnewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there\\nwould\\nappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how\\ndramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the\\nsituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued\\nthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central\\nspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman\\'s\\nright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it\\'s\\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\\n\\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \\nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \\nwas annoying.)\\n\\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\\n\"organized\"\\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a \"secular\" Islam - an Islam\\nseparated from it\\'s Qur\\'an, it\\'s Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\\nmade\\nhis views known - the Muslim\\'s made their anger at his book known. The\\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\\ntime,\\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\\nindividuals.\\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\\nengaged\\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\\n\\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\\n\\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\\nkind, has no\\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in \"boldly\"\\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\\na kind of secular \"heroic Knight\",mounted on the his media steed,\\n doing battle with the \"dragon\" of Islamic \"fundamentalism\".\\n\\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \\ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim\\'s hold dear, \\nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\\nwho, when\\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie\\'s continued media mischief\\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\\n\\n\\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. \"Image\" is\\nthe chief concern of Muslim \\'apologists\\' for Islam and for Rushdie.\\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\\nwould then be thought to have a good \"image\" (Principally because it would\\nby and large reflect the secular image). A \"good image\" usually means \" be\\nmore\\nlike me\".\\n\\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\\nthat\\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.\\n', '\\n\\nHow big of a lightning rod, would you need for protection?\\nand  would you need jupiter as a ground plane.', '\\nVell, this is perfectly normal behaviour Vor a Vogon, you know?', 'Jeremiah:\\n25:27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of\\nhosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and\\nfall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among\\nyou.\\n25:28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to\\ndrink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye\\nshall certainly drink.\\n', '\\n\\n\\nSurely it was intended as wit.\\n\\nBy the way, which \"atheist cause\" were you referring to, Bill?\\n\\n', 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\n\\nEditorial Contact:\\nSingle Source Marketing:  Myra Manahan    (714) 545-1338\\nGenoa Systems:            Joseph Brunoli  (408) 432-9090\\n                          Neil Roehm      (408) 432-9090/Technical\\n\\n\\n                      Genoa Presents High Performance \\n                        Video Graphics Accelerator\\n\\n        SAN JOSE, Calif USA -- Genoa Systems Corporation announces \\nWINDOWSVGA 24,  a True Color 24-bit graphics accelerator card that \\ndelivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the \\ncompetition.

His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.

The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.

Somehow I doubt do that yourself\\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \\n\\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\\ncarved with the Pharoah\\'s specific approval so we have true originals, rather\\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \\nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \\n\\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \\nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\\nII.\\n\\n\\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\\n\\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\\n\\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\\n\\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\\n\\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\\n\\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\\n\\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\\n\\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\\n\\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \\nbattle.)\\n\\n\\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\\n\\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\\n\\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\\n\\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\\n\\n\\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\\n\\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\\n\\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\\n\\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\\n\\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\\n\\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\\n\\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\\n\\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\\n\\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\\n\\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\\n\\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\\n\\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\\n\\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\\n\\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\\n\\t...\\n\\tI call to you, my father Amun,\\n\\tI am among a host of strangers;\\n\\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\\n\\tI am alone, there\\'s none with me!\\n\\t...\\n\\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\\n\\tAmun is more helpful than they;\\n\\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\\n\\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\\n\\n\\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\\n\\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\\n\\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\\n\\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\\n\\tHe called from behind as if near by:\\n\\t\"Forward, I am with you,\\n\\tI your father, my hand is with you,\\n\\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\\n\\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\\n\\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\\n\\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\\n\\t...\\n\\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\\n\\tNot one looked behind him,\\n\\tNot one turned around,\\n\\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\\n\\t...\\n\\tOne called out to the other saying:\\n\\t\"No man is he who is among us,\\n\\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\\n\\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\\n\\tThey are of one who is unique,\\n\\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\\n\\tCome quick, flee before him,\\n\\tTo seek life and breathe air;\\n\\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\\n\\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\\n\\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\\n\\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\\n\\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\\n\\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\\n\\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \\nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.

I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\\nwords: \\n\\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\\n\\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\\ncompletely credible. \\n\\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\\nmust be true:\\n\\n \\nI have three points.  \\n\\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu\\'s past and\\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\\nthe testimony of Hindus:\\n\\n\\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \\n\\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \\n\\t hooey?\"\\n\\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\\npleading?\\n\\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \\n\\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\\ndeist.  Oh my).

A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed\\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard-to-handle\\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\\n  \\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\\n   Does it threaten DC-???.

[However, the majority \\nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\\n\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\\n\\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye\\'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\\nsalvation from death in a lion\\'s pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel\\'s\\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar\\'s transformation into a beast, a story that\\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\\nmartyr\\'s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.', '\\nI don\\'t necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with\\nyour reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma).\\nReligion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never \\nstate why faith and dogma are dangerous.  \\n\\nIf you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in\\nWaco, you are missing the point.  \\n\\nThe Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the\\nmessenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed\\neverything he said.  The problem wasn\\'t the religion, it was the \\nfollowers.  They didn\\'t die because of faith and dogma, they died because\\nof their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their\\nparents).\\n\\n\\nSo Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their\\nreligion only?  What are you saying?  One\\'s belief in a Christian God does\\nnot make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,\\nbut I\\'d rather hear you expand on the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of\\nbeing a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in\\nGod is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists\\nwould make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a\\nGod which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far\\ntoo much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion\\nbased on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this\\ndefinition imply that one cannot change one\\'s mind.  In prison, however,\\nyou can\\'t just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The\\ntwo are not compatible.\\n\\n\\n\\nI prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^)\\nSeriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn\\ngroups of people.

The problem with a \"moment of\\nsilence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion\\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\\n\\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\\nthis \"moment of silence\" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\\nChristian prayer DOESN\\'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \\nbeing able taking note of it.)\\n\\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\\n\"mainstream\" religion.\\n\\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\\ndoesn\\'t NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\\n\\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\\non non-Christians.\\n\\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it\\'s worth, I\\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\"\\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\\nthe world to do so.\\n\\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\\nsilence in school.

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          PHIGS\".\\n\\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\\n          based on PHIGS.\\n\\n          Next year\\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.\\n\\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\\n\\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\\n          mainframes.\\n\\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\\n          and translucency.\\n\\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\\n\\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\\n\\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\\n\\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company\\'s  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G\\'s data visual-\\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\\n          Starbase.\\n\\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most\\n          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many\\n          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-\\n          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing.

One could of course\\n#>|argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism (for example), but I just\\n#>|have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology\\n#>|to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it.\\n#>\\n#>IMO, the influence of Stalin, or for that matter, Ayn Rand, invalidates your\\n#>assumption that theism is the factor to be considered.\\n# \\n#Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.\\n#The point is that theism is *a* factor.\\n\\nThat\\'s your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful\\nas the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore\\nbelief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this\\nis *any* belief, not belief in Gods)\\n\\n#>Gullibility,\\n#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more\\n#>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of\\n#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators\\n#>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.\\n# \\n#That\\'s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the\\n#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.\\n\\nIf you believe that, you\\'re incredibly naive.\\n\\n#>Now, *some*\\n#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\\n#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned\\n#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction\\n#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?\\n#>\\n#That\\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\\n#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\\n#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\\n#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\\n\\nNo, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\\nwith *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\\'t implied by\\nwhat you say before, because you\\'re trying to sneak in \"innate features\\nof [all] theism\".  The word you\\'re groping for is \"some\".\\n\\n#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n\\nNo shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\nsince it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\nto the case you are trying to make?\\n\\n#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\\n#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.\\n\\nI said it reads like a warm up to that.

Someone\\nwho thinks reason is crap won\\'t buy it, you see.\\n\\n#Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics\\n#and mathematics are therfore circular.\\n\\nAnybody else think Godel was silly?\\n\\n#>The first part of the second statement contains no information, because\\n#>you don\\'t say what \"the beliefs\" are.  If \"the beliefs\" are strong theism\\n#>and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The\\n#>second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an\\n#>axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is\\n#>assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is\\n#>used to obtain it.\\n#>\\n# \\n#I\\'ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions\\n#of god here.\\n# \\n#An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here\\n#is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the\\n#axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\\n#out of which they are usually derived. \"I exist\" is derived, if you want\\n#it that way.\\n#\\n#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\\n# \\n#what is it you are trying to say?\\n\\nThat at some point, people always wind up saying \"this datum is reliable\" \\nfor no particular reason at all.  Example: \"I am not dreaming\".\\n\\n#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of\\n#>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.\\n#>\\n#>I can\\'t agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To\\n#>say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which\\n#>I suspect you do not have.\\n#>\\n# \\n#Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities\\n#with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or\\n#the way the world works.\\n\\nIMO, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does\\nnot mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of\\nintelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists, for example.\\n\\n#>|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen. It has to be true because I believe\\n#>|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. However, the beliefs say they are\\n#>|more than a work hypothesis.\\n#>\\n#>I don\\'t understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?\\n# \\n#Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make\\n#B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that\\n#it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating\\n#evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)\\n#says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further\\n#contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can\\n#have interesting effects.\\n\\nPeculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief\\nin gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren\\'t my \\ncatholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they \\ndon\\'t believe in it.  Maybe it\\'s the conjunction of \"B asserts B\" and\\n\"jail/kill dissenters\" that is important, and the belief in gods is\\nentirely irrelevant.

Because user don't see full 24bit\\nimage, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to\\nmodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if\\nimage is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7\\ncursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --\\nselecting individual color is possible from that.\\n\\nOk, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen\\nsuch in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention\\n24bit painting program in 8bit screen...\\n\\n\\n\\nIt saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\\ndesigned for that.\\nAlso, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,\\nperson would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\\nexpected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed\\nwithout thinking about human interface and how human expect the\\nprogram work -- design error.\\n\\nI have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\\nit were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\\nmajor change to the original design.\\n\\nSo, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\\nimages could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\\n\\nBefore anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\\n'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\\nup, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\\neven the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\\n(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\\n\\n\\nWell, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to\\nread it.\\n\", ': Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

His idea is \\nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\\nNeptune\\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\\n\\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects,\\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \\nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\\nideas about the formation of Earth\\'s moon.  There is good evidence\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\\'t), which can be used as evidence\\nfor the impact theory.\\n\\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\\'s \\norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\nbright, new frost.

He\\'d like\\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\\nmarketplace.\\n\\n  I\\'m just telling you what he said.\\n\\n                          Michael\\n', \"More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics\\nworkstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the\\nE&S Freedom.\\n\\n\\nHere is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nBrian\", '\\nDidn\\'t expect to find you in the Devil\\'s role, Stephen, but these are\\nthe times that try men\\'s souls.\\nNine months, as I understand it.

When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  Example:\\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.

However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!', '\\nYes, as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless.

[....]\\n\\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \\'hacker\\'\\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, know what \\'hacker\\' means from those who consider\\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\\n\\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \\'a UNIX\\n     hacker\\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \\'password\\n     hacker\\', \\'network hacker\\'.  See {cracker}.\\n\\n     The term \\'hacker\\' also tends to connote membership in the global\\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\\n\\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\\'ll quickly be labeled\\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\\n\\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\\n\\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\\n     project.\\n\\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\\n     see themselves as `benign\\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\\n\\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\\n     hackerdom\\'s most valuable intangible asset.\\n\\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\\n\\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \\'hacker\\'.  So,\\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\\nworkplace.  (This means that \\'hacker\\' is defined in terms of some well-known\\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\\n\\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\\'t work that way.\\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\\n\\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.

He did.  \\nWhether he was God or whether there is a God is a completely different \\nstory, however. \\n*****************************************************************************\\n\", \"\\tPersonally, I think it was Mrs. O'Leary's cow that knocked over that\\nlantern...\\n\\n:*)\", '\\nYes, that\\'s exactly what I felt.  My heart just felt that what I was\\nbeing taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message, but framed in\\nerrors.  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were\\nsomehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are \"guilty\" of their\\nlifestyle, that pride in one\\'s work is a bad thing, that Jesus died\\nfor me -- I don\\'t want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an\\nimpersonal act where the person can\\'t possibly even *know* me well\\nenough to really know if I\\'m worth dying for or not.\\n\\nI was never able to accept the bit about Jesus\\'s death being a good\\nthing.  If that means that I\\'m just not comprehending a basic message\\nof Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I\\'m just not compatible with\\nChristianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I\\ncan\\'t even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you\\ndescribe it, I\\'ve got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I\\ndon\\'t believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder --\\nnot because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren\\'t*\\nin my character.  You may think there\\'s nothing keeping me from just\\nrunning around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I\\'m able,\\ninsulting people for the heck of it, because I\\'m not answerable to\\nanyone; but you\\'d be wrong.  I\\'m answerable to myself.  A life like\\nthat would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.\\n\\n\\nMy initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching\\nand a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the \\'presence\\' of\\nGod with me.  I finally decided that I had once \"felt\" this presence\\njust as I had \"felt\" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a\\nlittle tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I\\nhad believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as\\nsomething of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.\\n\\nSince then, I\\'ve never abandoned the possibility that maybe your\\nsupernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in\\nmy darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for\\na moment and called out to whatever\\'s out there, because I want to\\nknow the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I\\nhave not yet received an answer.\\n\\n\\nNope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the\\nuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional\\nuniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same\\nway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional\\nsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts\\non this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-\\ndimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck\\nin a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables\\nbecome too much for us to even speculate on.\\n\\nThat is, there\\'s no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to\\nbe, so there\\'s no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor\\nhad anything to do with it.\\n\\n\\nChristians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy\\nbook, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt\\ntrips, insinuations that I\\'m without morals, arguments from disbelief\\n(\"how can you possibly believe that God *doesn\\'t* exist?\"), and so\\nforth.  All I\\'m asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,\\nbut it\\'s not going to be easy.\\n\\n\\nHaving had years upon years of contact with your religion from both\\nthe inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It\\npreys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it\\'s\\ngot these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly\\nintolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you\\'ll say\\nthat your religion doesn\\'t teach that -- but I\\'ve got to judge\\nChristianity from the Christians I know.\\n\\nI feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one\\'s\\nself, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason\\nthan that.\\n\\nSo I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some\\npeople think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly\\nvalid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity\\nwhatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to\\nrealize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,\\nfulfilled life.\\n\\nI have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice\\nthings.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses\\nis that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and\\nthey know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to\\nbelieve, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think\\nany less of people who don\\'t agree with them.\\n\\n\\nPrecisely my point.  You\\'ve still not given me a reason to be a\\nChristian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem...\\n\\n\\n... just as the Moslems aren\\'t religious, and the Buddhists aren\\'t\\nreligious.

Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).', '\\n\\n1.

Whether or not there is some \"right\"\\ninterpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to\\nread the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was\\nMichael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural\\ninfluence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but\\nregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point\\nof contention between Michael and myself. \\n\\nI have argued -- beyond Michael\\'s claims -- that the Christian\\nscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a\\nwide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their\\nmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that\\nthere is some \"right\" interpretation *unless* there is a way to\\ndetermine what that \"right\" interpretation is.  It is the lack of\\nan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that\\nputs the force behind the line I argue.\\n\\n\\nThere are enough Christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently\\nbroad range of color, that I can find a few that support my\\nexample. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully\\nacknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to\\ndetermine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity\\nhold dear.  He is willing to live and practice his religion\\nwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that\\nmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by\\nideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have\\ncalled conservative must also interpret, but they do not\\nrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and\\nimportance of this.\\n\\n\\nI recognize that Michael is part of the tradition.  But what does\\nit tell one about a tradition covering Origen, Aquinas, Jerry\\nFallwell, and Jesse Jackson that it also includes Michael Siemon?\\nNot very much!\\n\\n\\n\\nI think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christian\\nprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in\\nthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian\\nscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his\\npolitical stances.  That one should love one\\'s neighbor is a \\npurely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance \\nfor homosexuality is *not*.\\n\\nAs to these political stances, they are often at odds with what\\nis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I \\nsuspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other\\nhand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these \\npolitical stances become most influential when presented to \\nthose who need them most.)\\n\\n-*----\\n\\nHaving barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I\\ndoubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!', 'Invitation to the 8th SCIA\\n\\nThe 8th Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis will be\\narranged by the Norwegian Society for Image Processing and\\nPattern Recognition (NOBIM) and sponsored by the International\\nAssociation for Pattern Recognition (IAPR).

Someones even made the statement that science is\\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\\n\\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \\n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\\n    observable phenomenon.\\n\\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \\nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \\n\\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \\nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\\n\\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn\\'t seem to have an\\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \\nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \\n\\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\\nmanner you won\\'t like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone\\'s face,\"\\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\\nmorality. \\n\\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain\\'t necessarily so.  For instance, when a\\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\\nevidence.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler', 'Try spectrum.xerox.com [192.70.225.78] in /pub/map/dem.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that\\nKhomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an\\nand have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be\\nchecked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead,\\nreally can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has\\nresponded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should\\nbe quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist\\nmodes of obfuscationism. \\n\\nSo, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning \\nmore about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's \\nbasic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see \\nwho is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at \\nodds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve \\nmuslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles \\nof Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than \\nany other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical \\nnature.\\n\", '\\nBill, ever heard of secular humanism?

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n', '\\nIts just variation within a thread.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.

Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\nNeXT:\\n\\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\\ncurrently being re-organized, so it\\'s hard to point to specific\\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\\ndoes not support JPEG.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n', \" \\n \\nNo wonder that we don't see any detail for this claim.

Jesus doesn\\'t view\\nguilt like our modern venacular colors it.   \\n\\n\"Feelings\" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of \\nbeing guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a \\nreaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the \\nreaction.   Let me give you an example:\\n\\nHave you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a\\nlittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really \\ndidn\\'t know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?\\nAre you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You\\nare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  \\nFeelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus\\'s use of the word\\n\"guilt\" as how a court uses it.\\n\\nJesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being\\nimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do\\nbad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our \\nguilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. \\nWe are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is\\nnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us\\nsinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a\\nhuman being.  Guilty as charged.\\n\\n\\nYou can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you\\nmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in\\nthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the\\nway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.\\n\\nOr two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself\\nand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to\\nsay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way \\nJesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this \\ncategory to some extent in their lives.\\n\\nJesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt\\nfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he\\nloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That\\nisn\\'t new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize \\nthat this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.\\nThat is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to \\nhave your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.\\nJesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present\\nsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  \\n\\nGod is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into\\na round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to\\nchange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.\\nGod has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in\\nJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will\\nmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very\\nbeing--and us and God communicate with each through his\\nunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For\\nwith the divine nature living within us, we can now see\\nour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With\\nthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power\\nto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives \\nwithin us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before\\nwe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now \\nhave authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine \\nnature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit\\nis eternal.\\n\\nThe relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because\\nit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to\\nheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.\\nRemember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he\\nseparated the \"goats from the sheep\".   Many people in the\\nlast day will ask him, \"Didn\\'t I prophesy in your name and do\\nmiracles, and do good things in your name?\"   And what did Jesus say?\\n\"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.\"  That is the cornerstone of \\nChristianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your \\nrelationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will\\nbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  \\n\\n\\nGood.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you\\nlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus\\ntaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, \\nin the common english venacular, \"feeling guilty\" has a\\ndifferent meaning than the state of guilt.\\n\\n\\nI believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,\\na lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.\\n', \"\\nWouldn't bother me.

Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".

It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the\\nlines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical \\'insight\\' cannot\\nbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor\\'s new mind: Concerning\\ncomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose\\'s\\nclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim\\nthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,\\ncould be just illusions.\\n\\nWe are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder\\non the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,\\nrealising that it might not be anything special, but certainly\\nuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \\njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\\nin the future perform a \"total synthesis of C. elegans\" from\\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\\n\\n\\nThis is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains\\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture\\non our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to\\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \\n\\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \\nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\\nconscious. \\n\\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\\n\\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n\\nAgain, _brains are not computers_. Don\\'t forget this. This does not\\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\\nTheir primary \\'purpose\\' is perception and guidance of action, \\nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\\n\\n\\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of \\'green\\' in\\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\\nnot how I see it. The sensation \\'green\\' is a certain time-dependent\\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \\n\\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\\nbut this is just idle speculation.\\n\\nScientific American\\'s September 1992 issue was a special issue on\\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \\ninterested.\\n\\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \\nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \\nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\\nmind.\\n\\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \\npatients\\' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\\n\\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\\ntherapist.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\\n\\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \\n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\\n\\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\\n\\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\\n   of our \\'conscious will\\' by at least 350 ms. \\n\\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do \\'I\\' see\\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this \\'I\\' that seems to be \\nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\\nthe king of our brains.\\n\\n\\nThis depends on what is meant by \\'seeing colours\\'. Does a neural\\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\\n\\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\\ndoesn\\'t\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\\nroles and act more morally, so that they don\\'t unconsciously\\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\\nbut this is the basic idea.)\\n\\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \\na sense of identity and the concept of \\'self\\' had to evolve in\\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \\nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \\n\\n\\nIf minds are required for this, does this mean that until human\\nminds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained\\nin the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.\\n\\nThis has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant,\\nsince we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do\\nphysicists. \\n\\n\\nI agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics\\nneeds sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s OK, if you don\\'t forget to take with you the references I\\nwrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:\\n\\nKalat, James W.

See item 13 below for\\ndetails on some.\\n\\nAlso, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion\\nof software like this.  You may find useful information there.\\n\\n\\n8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.\\n\\nYou almost certainly don\\'t need these.  Read the above item 7 on free\\nimage manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and\\nlook through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you\\nwere going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the\\nformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from\\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.\\n\\nThese files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.\\nThis archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object\\nformats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark\\nHall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.\\n\\nA second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained\\nby Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).

It is important to understand that this is a very\\ndifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting\\none image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you\\nget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects\\nare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.\\nThe basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled\\nround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.\\nExcept in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do\\na one-to-one conversion between vector formats.\\n\\nThere is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The\\ncontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.\\nA better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,\\nrendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.\\nAs far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such\\nconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been\\nposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive\\nsite.\\n\\nA related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format\\nto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to\\nX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for\\nPC\\'s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,\\nthe PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun\\'s X11/NeWs can\\nbe used to render to a file if you\\'re clever.  But in general, the\\nanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to\\nvector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be\\ntrivial.\\n\\nGNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes\\ndrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as\\na PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements\\nessentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript\\nand level 2).\\n\\n\\n10) How to get Pixar films.\\n\\nThe various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available\\non video tape.

The approximation may look acceptable,\\nbut it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of\\napproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not\\nvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to\\ndo the job right, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles\"\\n  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller\\n  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,\\n  September, 1989, pages 48-56.\\n\\nFor rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:\\n\\n  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture\\n  by I.

It helps if you have the\\ncomplete name and number.\\n\\nSome useful numbers to know:\\n\\nCGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical\\nKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer\\'s Hierarchical\\nInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI\\nY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;\\nfor example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.\\n\\nStandards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit\\ncomments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let\\nyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering\\nat 1-800-854-7179.\\n\\n\\n13) How to FTP by email.\\n\\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\\n\\nIn addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to\\nftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying \"help\" and it will tell you how to use\\nit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.\\n\\n\\n14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.\\n\\nConsider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to\\ninfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,\\nthe point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of\\nedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior\\nhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in\\nthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines\\' article in\\nGlassner\\'s ray tracing book (above) for more information, including\\ntreatment of special cases.\\n\\nAnother method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all\\nthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,\\nif the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an\\norder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the\\ntrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.\\n\\nCode for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in\\nthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:\\npub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.\\n\\n\\n15) How to tessellate a sphere.\\n\\nOne simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.

It is portable and usable upon\\na wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the\\nkeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don\\'t like\\nit much.

The other x\\nthree instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form\\nan image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the \\nresolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different\\nbeast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of \\nthe craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the \\ndifferential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.\\nPositional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors\\nand errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have\\nany independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to\\ndetermine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small \\ncomponent to the positional error.  \\n\\nDemonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would \\nrequire resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort \\ncloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together \\nnow: \"Parallax ARc SECond\", a parsec is the distance of an object \\nthat demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).\\nIf the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we\\'re going to \\nhave to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.\\n\\nThe beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and\\nwatches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination\\nwhen you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExactly...\\n\\nI didn\\'t want to mess with tga or rle.

I\\'ll\\n(provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support\\nthe allegations?]\\n\\nActually I wasn\\'t thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about\\nthe reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several\\nwomen in the cult.  I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting\\nadults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh\\'s\\nbeliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not a\\ncivil liberties perspective.  \\n\\nI think my question is not really aimed at Joe (and possibly not at\\nRay Cote either, who seems to also be taking the political angle), but\\nat Stephen Tice.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nbut theology is full of reason even if it is, as we believe, based on false\\npremises etc etc.\\n\\n\\nhold on there: no meaning to \"consciousness\" or \"mind\" or \"self\"?!\\n\\n\\nwhat illogicality?\\n\\n\\nsince when is, for instance, (non-behaviourist) psychology a pipe dream? \\nSurely the major purpose of the science of psychology is to understand the\\nworkings of the mind.\\n\\n\\n\"manifestations of the mundane\" sounds rather transcendental to me.

The\\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\\n\\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\\n\\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\\n\\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\\n\\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\\n\\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\\nManagement System.\\n\\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\\n\\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\\n\\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\\n\\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\\npropulsion systems.\\n\\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\\n\\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\\noperations costs, he said.\\n\\n¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\\n\\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\\nattitude.\\n\\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\'Connor\\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\\n\\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \\nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\\n\\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\\n\\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\\nmanagement options have been developed including:\\n\\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\\ncommand.\\n\\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\\nAdministrator.\\n\\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\\nhand-picked program office.\\n\\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\\nelement of the current program.\\n\\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\\n\\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\\n\\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\\nand ground operations.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\\nbe held May 3.\\n\\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\'Connor will take over the\\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\\n\\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\\ncarried on the schedule are:\\n\\nApril 26\\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\\n\\nApril 27\\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\\n\\nMay 3\\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nMay 15\\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nJune 7\\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n', '\\nIf I remember correctly Prometheus books have this one in stock,\\nso just call them and ask for the book.\\n\\nCheers,\\nKent', 'I have also been looking for this, but I have come up with nothing.\\nI have looked in ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu which is supposed to have a lot\\nof image-specs.\\n\\nEmail is preferred.

It\\'s true that a hydraulically\\npressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube,\\nbut even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily,\\nthough it\\'s straight-on compressive strength is high, and it\\'s torsional \\nresistance increase is practically nil.

If you take the view that the\\ntail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the\\ntail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case\\nof the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather\\nthan locomotion. I don\\'t know much about panda \"thumbs\", so I\\'ll ask\\nis it opposable?\\n\\n\\nWell I won\\'t say flat out that they can\\'t be intelligent, but I\\'ll\\nbring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I\\ndon\\'t think it\\'s likely. First let me say that when I say \"intelligent\"\\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \\nit\\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\\'s certainly not\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\n\\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\nit\\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\\nwouldn\\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\\'s room\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\nlarge creatures. So there\\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\\'t rule out\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\n\\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\\'s internal heat is rapidly\\nlost due to it\\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\\nthat must spend most of it\\'s time and energy feeding won\\'t have the time\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\\nThe dinosaur\\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\\'s heat production \\nbecause it\\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\nI\\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\n\\nGary', 'TEST-- \\n\\n', \"\\nWhy don't you tell us, Tony?

As another poster\\nsaid, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable\\nlaying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying\\na transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to\\ncarry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for\\ndefective sections.

If you had wanted to get right\\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \\nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \\nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \\nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\\n\\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\\n\\n\\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\\nthe rapture until Christ\\'s second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob\\'s\\n(Israel\\'s) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel\\'s Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \\nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\\n\\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\\n\\n\\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \\n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \\npossession during the Tribulation.\\n\\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \\nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\\nunfold before you.  \\n\\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \\nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \\nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\\nsake of Christ.  \\n\\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\\n\\n\\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \\nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \\nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \\n\\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \\nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\\'s\\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \\nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \\nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\\n\\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \\nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \\nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \\ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\\nthe mark.  \\n\\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \\nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \\nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \\npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \\n14:9-10 \\n\\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \\n\\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\\n\\n\\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\\'s government\\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \\nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\\n\\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist\\'s control will come last to the least\\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \\nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\\nclosings\" --M] \\nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \\nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\\n\\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\\n\\t\\n\\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\\'s\\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\\n\\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\\n\\n\\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \\n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \\nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \\npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \\npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\\n\\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \\nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\\n\\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\\n\\n\\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \\nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \\n\\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \\nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\\n\\n\\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\\n\\n******************************************************************************\\nMike Cluff\\t\\t\\t\\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\\t*  \\n******************************************************************************\\n\\n\\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\ \\n\\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \\n\\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.', \"Hi.  I'm  looking for information on how to directly manipulate\\n video memory.  I have an application that I would like to use this for,\\n because it is much faster than going through the BIOS.

Thanks.\", '\\nMy apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but \\ngot a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering \\nthe confusing spitting contest over \\'rights\\', (there are TOO \\ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \\nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \\nof my site.    (I ain\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \\nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\n\\nRegards, \\nWm.
