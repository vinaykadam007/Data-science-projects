    "## Exercise - Clustering Iris flowers using Kmeans\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the famous iris dataset to cluster them based on their features. The dataset is at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is to cluster the flowers with Kmeans. Perform the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the data into python using pandas.\n",
    "2. The flower column of the data is a string denoting the flower. Convert Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica to numbers 0, 1, 2 respectively with a lambda method and apply method of pandas. \n",
    "3. Plot a scatter of petal length vs petal width, and a scatter of sepal length vs sepal width. Plot a histogram of the flower column, i.e flowers vs number of rows. How many clusters do you think should be there?\n",
    "4. Now run Kmeans algorithm on the Sepal width & Sepal Length(not on the full dataset), with number of clusters as 3. Pass centroids as (3, 5), (3, 7) & (2.5, 6). The number of iterations for running kmeans should be 5. What is output centroids of the Kmeans? Is it the ones which you passed?\n",
    "5. Plot the output of Kmeans depicting sepal length & width, colored according to clusters and obtained centroids. Is this a good clustering? \n",
    "6. Next run the Kmeans algorithm using 'k-means++' , and number of clusters 3. The number of iterations for running kmeans should be 5. What are the output centroids obtained? Plot the output of Kmeans depicting sepal length & width, colored according to clusters and obtained centroids. Is this a good clustering? Compare your output to the output obtained in Question 5. \n",
    "7. Compute the silhoutte co-efficients for both the above methods. Compare their values? What are your observations?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repeat Questions 3 through 7 with petal length and petal width. The centroids should (2, 0.5), (4, 1), (5, 2). Which features give you a better clustering of the flowers? \n",
